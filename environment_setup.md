# Environment Setup for Data Processing Pipeline

This guide will walk you through setting up a data processing pipeline using Docker, SQL Server, Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, and Azure Machine Learning.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

# Docker: For running SQL Server locally in a container.
# Azure Account: To access Azure services like Data Lake, Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, Power BI, and Azure Machine Learning.

## Step 1: Set Up SQL Server in Docker

1. Pull the Microsoft SQL Server Docker image:
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest

2. Run the SQL Server container with a specified password:
   docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong!Passw0rd' -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest

3. Use a tool like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio to connect to the running SQL Server instance.

4. Upload your raw datasets into the SQL Server instance for further processing.

## Step 2: Create Azure Data Lake and Data Factory

1. Create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account:
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal and create a Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This will be used for storing your raw datasets.

2. Set up Azure Data Factory:
   - In the Azure Portal, create an Azure Data Factory.
   - Build a data pipeline that extracts data from the SQL Server instance and loads it into the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.

## Step 3: Set Up Databricks for Data Processing

1. Create an Azure Databricks workspace:
   - In the Azure Portal, create a Databricks workspace.
   - Launch a Databricks cluster for executing data transformations.

2. Install Delta Lake in your Databricks environment:
   - In the Databricks workspace, install the Delta Lake library by adding the appropriate Maven coordinates (io.delta:delta-core_2.12:1.2.1 for example) to your clusterâ€™s configuration.

3. Process the data:
   - Use Spark and Delta Lake to process, transform, and clean the data from Azure Data Lake.

## Step 4: Azure Synapse Analytics Setup

1. Create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace:
   - In the Azure Portal, create a Synapse Analytics workspace for querying and analyzing your transformed data.

2. Connect Databricks to Synapse:
   - Configure Databricks to output processed data into Synapse Analytics for advanced analytics and querying.

## Step 5: Power BI and Azure Machine Learning

1. Power BI for data visualization:
   - Connect Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics for real-time data visualization and reporting.

2. Azure Machine Learning for model training:
   - Use Azure Machine Learning to build and train machine learning models on the processed data.
   - Deploy the models for production use, as needed.

## Notes

- Ensure your SQL Server container has sufficient resources to handle the data.
- Keep your Azure account credentials safe, and follow best practices for securing data in the cloud.
- Use Power BI dashboards to monitor and visualize data trends.
- Experiment with various machine learning models in Azure Machine Learning for better insights from your data.
